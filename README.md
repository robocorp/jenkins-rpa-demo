# RoboJenkins demo
## Description
This is an example project for running [Robot Framework RPA](https://robotframework.org/rpa/) tasks with [Robocorp tools](https://robocorp.com/docs/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). See the instructions below how to run it on Linux/Mac or Windows.

This project installs and configures Jenkins for you in a Docker container, with a ready-made Multibranch pipeline Robot Framework RPA demo job. Note that this is not a production-ready environment, using this for real-life purposes is not recommended. See technical details for more information.

## Instructions
Short:
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. ```docker build -t robodemo .```
3. * Linux/Mac: ```docker run -p 8080:8080 --env JAVA_OPTS=-Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP= -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --detach --name robodemo robodemo```
    * Windows: ```docker run -p 8080:8080 --env JAVA_OPTS=-Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP= -v jenkins_home://var/jenkins_home -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --detach --name robodemo robodemo```
4. Open browser to http://localhost:8080
5. Login with admin / RoboCorpRules2020!
6. Click "robodemo" to open the demo project
7. Click Scan multibranch pipeline from the left-hand side
8. Refresh, see that the job starts scanning first, then building the master branch
9. Click to open the master, check the results. Click build #1 from left-hand side to see full console output and more information.

## Details
### General
The Jenkins master will run on your own computer. The agents, that are also containers, are also running on the same computer. Running jobs on the master node is a bad practice, and this is the first thing that should be taken into account when using Jenkins for real use-cases. Either spin up resources on-the-fly with e.g. EC2 or Azure slaves plugins or use a Kubernetes cluster (EKS, AKS plugins), or use e.g. ECS for this purpose. How to set these up depends on your use case, but all of these plugins have a fairly good documentation, so Google is your friend :) Or, if you have an existing infrastructure with virtual/physical machines running somewhere, just use them as your agents as such: install Java, and either let Jenkins master connect to them with SSH, or connect to Jenkins master from the agent with JNLP. Read more about [Jenkins remoting here](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/remoting/).

Remember that nowadays, SSH works fine in Windows too. Use e.g. [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). This is way more stable and secure than using JNLP, WinRM or so.

### Files and folders
- Dockerfile - uses jenkins/jenkins:lts docker image, installs the needed tools, installs the needed Jenkins plugins, and executes the groovy scripts for other Jenkins magic.
- jenkins-plugins - A text file containing the plugins that are wanted to be installed automatically.
- scripts/ - Folder for Groovy scripts, that are executed automatically every time that Jenkins boots up. Used for e.g. creating the default user and Jenkins jobs.

- Jenkinsfile - A simple [declarative pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline) for installing and running [Robot Framework RPA](https://robotframework.org/rpa/) tasks with [Robocorp CLI](https://robocorp.com/docs/product-manuals/robocorp-lab/robocorp-cli-manual) in an Ubuntu docker container, as well as parsing the Robot Framework results.

### How to proceed onto a Real Jenkins setup
- Think where you want to run your Jenkins, and especially where to run the jobs - EC2/Azure slaves, ECS, EKS/AKS, your own Kubernetes cluster, or whatnot. Don't run these on Jenkins master, or it'll only make your system unstable and overloaded.
- Make the setup secure: enable https, and configure the security groups / load balancers / firewall etc.
- Integrate into AD: use e.g. [SAML SSO](https://github.com/jenkinsci/saml-plugin) (Check the instructions and examples)
- Use [Role-based authorization strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/role-strategy/) and map the roles e.g. into AD groups.
